# NEUB-CSE-Department

This was my first Database Management System learning project. I created this website to manage courses, teachers information, students information and run CSE Society (The society which conducts all of the events of cse society including programming contest, picnic, machine learning contest, manage bloods etc.). I used MySQL for the database.
I also used PHP, HTML, CSS.
